## Patient Management System
This project involves building a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to streamline core patient management processes. The platform will feature modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, and medical records management. By centralizing these functions, it aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce administrative workload, and enhance the patient experience.

Key features include:

Patient Registration: Simplified registration with user-friendly, secure forms that handle personal information, insurance details, and medical history, allowing for seamless onboarding of new patients.

Appointment Scheduling: An intuitive scheduling system that lets patients book, modify, and track appointments with healthcare providers. It includes a real-time view of available slots and automated reminders.

Medical Records Management: Secure, accessible storage for patient medical histories, diagnostic reports, and treatment records, ensuring that both healthcare providers and patients can access vital information when needed.

Complex Forms & SMS Notifications: Implementation of advanced form functionalities to handle multiple data types and conditional fields, alongside SMS notification capabilities to send real-time updates, reminders, and confirmations to patients.
